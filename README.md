SenseWay - Neurodiverse-Friendly Navigation Assistant

SenseWay is an AI-powered navigation assistant designed to prioritize comfort and calmness, catering to neurodiverse individuals who navigate the world differently. Unlike traditional navigation apps that focus solely on the fastest route, SenseWay offers multiple route options based on a custom Calmness Score that factors in noise levels, air quality, distance, and time. With features like real-time navigation, augmented reality (AR) overlays, peer monitoring, and an emergency support system, SenseWay empowers users with sensory-friendly, personalized navigation experiences.

Introduction
SenseWay redefines navigation by focusing on mental and sensory comfort, particularly for neurodiverse users who may experience sensory overload or anxiety during travel. By integrating advanced APIs like Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap, and Noise APIs, along with AR.js for immersive navigation, SenseWay provides a holistic platform that adapts to real-time environmental conditions and user preferences. Its unique Calm Sync feature dynamically updates routes to ensure the calmest possible journey, while AR navigation and peer monitoring enhance accessibility and safety.
Key Features
1. Real-Time Navigation with Calm Sync

Multiple Route Options: Generates up to 3‚Äì5 routes using Google Directions API, ranked by a Calmness Score:[C = w_1 \times (1 - \frac{N}{N_{max}}) + w_2 \times (1 - \frac{AQI}{AQI_{max}}) + w_3 \times (1 - \frac{T}{T_{max}}) + w_4 \times (1 - \frac{D}{D_{max}})]Where:
(C): Calmness Score
(N): Noise Level (dB)
(AQI): Air Quality Index
(T): Estimated Time (minutes)
(D): Distance (km)
Weights ((w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)): Customizable (default: 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)


Calm Sync: Automatically reevaluates routes at checkpoints based on live noise, AQI, and traffic data, ensuring adaptive navigation.
Calmest Route Button: One-tap selection of the highest-scored route for users needing quick decisions.
Rest Stops: Suggests nearby parks and hospitals for mental or physical breaks, with noise and distance filters.
Pegman Integration: Google Street View previews for sensory environment assessment at key decision points.

2. AR Navigation

Modern Dashboard UI: Right-side dashboard with start/destination inputs, navigation start button, and voice toggle, powered by Google Places API autocompletion.
AR Live View: Uses AR.js and <gps-camera> to overlay directional rings and step-by-step instructions in real space.
Real-Time Step Advancement: Automatically progresses instructions when within 10 meters of a waypoint using navigator.geolocation.watchPosition.
Voice Guidance: Provides spoken instructions alongside on-screen AR cues for accessibility.
Mobile-Optimized: Fully responsive, tested on Chrome Android with GPS and camera support.

3. Environmental Insights

Live Data: Fetches real-time AQI, noise levels, temperature, and humidity via OpenWeatherMap and Noise APIs.
Neurodiverse-Friendly Visuals: Color-coded metrics (üü¢ Good, üü° Moderate, üî¥ Poor) with minimal visual noise.
Periodic Updates: Refreshes data every 60 seconds without page reloads.

4. Peer Monitoring System

Live Location Sharing: Shares user location, route progress, and ETA with trusted peers via WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database.
Context-Aware: Peers see full route details, checkpoints, and Calm Sync updates.
Alerts & Check-Ins: Includes check-in buttons, automatic deviation alerts, and a panic button for emergencies.
Privacy-Centric: Opt-in sharing, session-based, with automatic termination upon journey completion.

5. Emergency Support

Floating SOS Button: Expands to offer context-based triggers (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Overwhelmed,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedical Emergency‚Äù).
Location Fetching: Retrieves GPS coordinates and reverse-geocodes to a readable address using Nominatim.
Nearby Safe Spaces: Lists hospitals within 5km via Overpass API.
Calming Toolkit: Includes guided breathing audio and coping guidance for neurodiverse distress scenarios.

6. Profile Personalization

Neurodiverse-Focused: Captures sensory sensitivities, mobility preferences, communication styles, and emergency contacts.
Data Persistence: Stores data in localStorage with optional server sync via /api/auth/signup.
AI Customization: Toggles for peer monitoring, calm score suggestions, and anomaly detection.

7. AI Chatbot (Navi)

Floating Interface: Minimal, responsive chatbot for navigation and page routing.
Rule-Based Logic: Handles greetings, navigation commands, and page redirects using keyword detection.
Offline-Compatible: Works without API calls, ensuring reliability in low-network scenarios.

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
APIs:
Google Maps JavaScript API (Directions, Places, Geometry, Street View)
OpenWeatherMap API (AQI, temperature, humidity)
Noise APIs (e.g., Ambiciti, Noise-API, placeholders for future integration)
Overpass API (hospital locations)
Nominatim (reverse geocoding)


AR: AR.js, A-Frame, <gps-camera>
Backend: Firebase (hosting, Realtime Database for peer monitoring)
Storage: localStorage for offline profile data
Styling: Tailwind CSS (planned), custom CSS for neurodiverse-friendly UI
Fonts: System default for performance, Poppins as fallback
Deployment: Firebase Hosting with enhanced cache settings
